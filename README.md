# The Chorus
## Code for Jasleen Kaur Kinetic Sculpture

### Test_Movement
Manually tests position movement to confirm accurate functionality

### Bounce_test
Sketch that allows motor movement arguments to be changed and set so the arm movement hits the cymbal at the right speed and height. 

### Rhythms Motor A and B
Two nearly identical sketches that trigger rhythm sequences of each motor. Can be run manually with 0-9 and a-f key presses or can be run on a timer for installation/production once sequences confirmed.
